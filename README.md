# Unsupervised-learning---Identifiying-Spam-Emails

Summary: - The objective of this task is to analyze the Spambase dataset, which consits of spam and non-spam emails, to obtain insights on how to distinguish between both by clustering them into different groups using unsupervised learning techniques. The dataset contains frequency of certain words used in an email, percentage of a certain character that is included in an email, and average, sum and lenght of uninterrupted capital letters used. The data does contain a target variable, which will be used to calculated the Adjusted Rand Index Score. The data was collected using reported spam emails by individuals and non-spam emails came from reported personal emails. The data can be accessed from kaggle by accessing the link: https://www.kaggle.com/somesh24/spambase

Methods: To analyze the dataset, the data will be cleaned and processed. If the data is not balanced, the data will be balanced to equate the number of samples from each group. Then, we will choose the number of clusters(k) by calculating the Sum of Squared Errors(SSE) and graph. After choosing the right number of clusters, four clustering algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and GMM are implemented. To visualize the clusters in each algorithm, dimensionality reduciton techniques as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP are implemented. Finally, the ARI and Silhoutte scores are calcualted to select the best performing model.
